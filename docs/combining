How to link ODL and Mininet:

1. follow all directions in ODL and Mininet docs.

2. Obtain the ip address of your ODL instance. I used a separate machine to host my ODL instance and gave it a static route in my home network.

3. Make sure you have allowed interal network access to port 6653 on your ODL machine. This is the port mininet will use to connect to ODL.
3.1: is ufw is enabled, running: sudo ufw allow 6653 will work!

4. run the following command on your mininet machine:
sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=[ODL IP Address],port=6653 --topo=tree,1,3 --mac --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

for example, on my setup I run:
sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=192.168.1.239,port=6653 --topo=tree,1,3 --mac --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

5. you can now run pingall to test your configuration. if all packets are dropped, try running:
telnet [ODL IP Address] 6653

If telnet is able to connect, then you have verified that your port is properly setup.

If you are still having issues, go through the directions again.
