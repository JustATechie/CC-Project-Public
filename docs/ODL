How to setup OpenDayLight:

1. Create a fresh Ubuntu installation (either on vm or physical; in these directions I used a physical installation so you may need to adapt certain parts)

2. Install git using: sudo apt-get install git

3. install curl using: sudo apt install curl

3. install java using: sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

4. download ODL using:
curl -O https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.release/org/opendaylight/integration/distribution-karaf/0.6.0-Carbon/distribution-karaf-0.6.0-Carbon.zip

5. perform the following:
sudo cp distribution-karaf-0.6.0-Carbon.zip /opt/
cd /opt/
sudo unzip distribution-karaf-0.6.0-Carbon.zip
sudo mv distribution-karaf-0.6.0-Carbon odl

this will unzip and move the ODL download into a folder called odl within /opt/

6. set your java home
sudo nano /etc/environment

add the following below your PATH:

JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/jre/"

you may need to reboot after this step.

7. return to the /opt/odl/ folder and run odl!
cd /opt/odl/
sudo ./bin/karaf

8. you'll now be greeted with the ODL interface. Perform the following commands:
feature:install odl-dluxapps-applications odl-netvirt-openstack odl-mdsal-all odl-l2switch-all
feature:install odl-restconf odl-l2switch-switch odl-mdsal-apidocs

odl-netvirt-openstack
odl-mdsal-all
odl-l2switch-all

troubleshooting:
if for whatever reason you are having issues with ODL you can run:
sudo ./bin/karaf clean

this will start ODL and remove all previously installed features.


Ports:
You will need to open ports:
6653 and 8181 on this machine.

To do so you must run:
sudo ufw allow 6653
sudo ufw allow 8181
(this is of course assuming ufw is enabled.)

Port 6653 is what mininet will use to connect to ODL.
Port 8181 is what we will connect to in a web interface to see the ODL visualizer.

Finalizing:
At this point you should be able to go to:
http://localhost:8181/index.html#/topology
on the machine Ubuntu is running on to see the visualizer.

Alternatively, if you have opened port 8181 on this machine you can connect to:
http://[ODL IP Address]:8181/index.html#/topology
to see the visualizer on another machine in the same network.
