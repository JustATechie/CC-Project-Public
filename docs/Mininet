How to setup Mininet:

1. Create a fresh Ubuntu installation (either on vm or physical; in these directions I used a physical installation so you may need to adapt certain parts)

2. Install openvswitch using: sudo apt install openvswitch-switch

3. run the following to enable openvswitch on startup.

2. Install git using: sudo apt-get install git

2. Clone the mininet repo using:

git clone https://github.com/mininet/mininet

3. Perform the following commands:
cd mininet/
git checkout -b mininet-2.3.0 2.3.0
cd ..

4. install mininet using:
mininet/util/install.sh -a

5. you can now run mininet using:
sudo mn

See "combining" doc for how to connect mininet to ODL.
