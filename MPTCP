This was the process I followed to install the kernel. This was successful on Ubuntu 20LTS but
not on Ubuntu 14 or 16. Thus, MPTCP was unable to be tested.

Setting up MPTCP:

https://multipath-tcp.org/pmwiki.php/Users/HowToInstallMPTCP?

First we'll need to install the MPTCP kernel

Download all .deb files for current release from: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp/releases

Run the following two commands in the folder where you downloaded the files.
sudo dpkg -i linux*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f

Once you do that, it will automatically try to an an entry in grub. Depending on how you setup your
envrionment this may or may not work. I installed my ubuntu instance on a separate usb device from my main
laptop internal drive. I already had grub configured on my laptop so I had to boot into my main distro
(Arch Linux) and run grub customizer with os-prober enabled to add an entry in my main grub boot loader.

Once you are able to see the ubuntu mptcp version of linux in grub, go ahead and boot into it.
I immediately performed an upgrade:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

I had an issue where my wifi card was "too new" for this version of the linux kernel and to not waste time
attemping to debug it, i just plugged in via ethernet.

Open up a terminal instance and run:
sudo sysctl -a | grep mptcp

If you get output that looks like this:
kernel.osrelease = 4.19.234.mptcp
net.mptcp.mptcp_checksum = 1
net.mptcp.mptcp_debug = 0
net.mptcp.mptcp_enabled = 1
net.mptcp.mptcp_path_manager = fullmesh
net.mptcp.mptcp_scheduler = default
net.mptcp.mptcp_syn_retries = 3
net.mptcp.mptcp_version = 0

Then you are all set and ready to run tests.
