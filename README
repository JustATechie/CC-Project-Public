This project attempts to implement a number of TCP flavors over a few different topologies to see which
is most efficient per protocol flavor.

How to run:
cd src/setup/
python startup.py [topology][protocol][logging level]

where topology can be:
'-1': Test Topo
'0': Fat Tree
'1': Leaf-Spine
'2': Super-Spine
'3': Super-Spine

where protocol can be:
'0': TCP
'1': STCP
'2': DCTCP
'3': MPTCP

where logging level can be:
none: warnings and errors
'0': info
'1': debug

Note about logging: error codes are always preceded with an error log.

ERROR CODE INFO:
1: Invalid topology argument
2: Invalid protocol argument
3: Invalid logging level argument

These will output flows between the furthest hosts as a csv file which can be parsed into a chart.
