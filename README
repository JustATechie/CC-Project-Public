Note: original project files are in V1 branch!

To setup the main branch:

Setup a mininet vm with version 2.2.2-170321 running ubutnu 14.04.4-server-amd64

Read MPTCP for installing MPTCP kernel.

Clone this repo and run the following:
in one terminal:
pox/pox.py forwarding.hub

in another terminal in the root directory of this repo:
sudo python3 src/learning/linear_test.py [arg]

arguments:
(From section ii.2 in paper)
1 for simple pingall and iperf then exit

(to run all other sections)
2 for cli

To run bandwidth and transfer tests:
xterm h1 h2

(repeat these under the MPTCP kernel for those results)
=====TCP TESTS======

within h2:
iperf -s

within h1:
for tcp uni tests:
iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -t 500 -i 0.5 > h1toh2-500sec.txt

(change 500 in the above command to 60 to run the 60 second variant)

for tcp dual tests:
iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -d -i 1 -t 500 > dual500sec.txt

=====UDP TESTS====

within h2:
iperf -s -u

within h1:

for udp uni tests:
iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -t 500 -i 0.5 -u > h1toh2-500sec-udp.txt

(change 500 in the above command to 60 to run the 60 second variant)

for udp dual tests:
iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -d -i 1 -t 500 -u > dual500sec-udp.txt
